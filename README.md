# Kaggle-Titanic-Challenge
# Solving the Kaggle Titanic dataset challenge in 1 hour.

This is my first attempt and entry into any Kaggle competition. I choose to start with the famous Titanic problem. 
I further also set a challenge for myself to solve the problem in under 1 hour. 
I was able to finish this in under one hour with a tuned RF classification model. 
The resulting model placed in the 77th percentile. Not bad for one hour of coding. I plan on returning to this challenge in the future with a goal of 95 percentile or better.
